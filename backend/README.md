# Backend of Life Management Application
To get the project started, make sure python and your virtual environment are set up correctly.

To create a virtual environment, please use the command:

<code> python -m venv venv </code>

This will create a virtual environment in the directory called venv. Please do not commit any virtual environment files, as this will take up unnecessary space

Then, run:  
<code> python manage.py runserver </code>
